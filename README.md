scent maker simulator game on progress...

Theme and Goal
The player is a fragrance chemist who creates unique perfumes, opens their own perfume shop, and aims to become famous with their growing perfume collection.

Gameplay Loop:
- Buy perfume licenses
- Create perfumes by following recipes
- Add new scents to your collection
- Earn money through sales

Setting:
Perfume Shop:Inside the shop, there is a counter where you interact with customers and handle the cash register
A workbench where you mix scents to make perfumes
Decorative counters where finished perfumes are displayed and can be sampled by customers
At higher levels, the player can explore different parts of the city to find rare essences.

Core Mechanics

License & Essence Purchasing:
Each perfume requires a separate license. Once the license is purchased, the perfume’s recipe becomes visible. You need to purchase the required essences from different locations in the city (or via a computer system).

Sales Mechanic:
Some customers will ask for a perfume by name, while others will describe their favorite scent note and expect you to recommend something.
If you choose and give a perfume with that note, the customer is satisfied. If you give the wrong option, the customer becomes upset, and you lose experience points.Sales are made from the products available in your inventory.
If you don’t have the requested item, you can select a “come back later” option — but this also costs you experience points.
Product prices are fixed. The cost to create each perfume is specified when buying the license. As you level up, you can purchase licenses for higher-value perfumes.The player can choose between making high-profit perfumes or experimenting with new ones to expand their collection — adding a layer of strategic decision-making.

Stock Mechanic:
Since missing items lead to experience point loss, keeping an eye on inventory is crucial.
You can check your current stock in the inventory section.

Perfume Crafting Mechanic:
When you approach the perfume workbench, a UI panel appears — background sounds of perfume bottles and animations can enhance the experience.
Top left: Select the perfume you want to craft from your list of licenses; the recipe details are displayed.
Bottom left: Your available essences from inventory are shown; hover over them to see their names.
Right side: There are nine empty slots labeled top, middle, and base notes, where you drag essences from the left.
Center: There’s a mix button.
Once you decide on the perfume, you enter how many you want to craft (each additional unit increases the wait time), then start the mixing process.The finished perfumes are automatically added to your inventory.
